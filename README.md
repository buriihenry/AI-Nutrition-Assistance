Staying consistent with healthy eating habits is challenging, especially for individuals navigating dietary restrictions or trying to achieve specific healthy goals. Many find the overwhelming number of meal options and nutritional information daunting, leading to confusion and frustration. Traditional meal planning often lacks personalization and accessibility, making it difficult for users to make informed decisions about their diets.

The AI Nutrition Assistant provides a conversational AI that simplifies meal planning and nutrition guidance. By understanding usersâ€™ dietary preferences, the assistant offers tailored meal suggestions, easy-to-follow recipes, and instructions.

## Project overview

1. Personalized Meal Recommendations: Suggest meals based on dietary preferences (e.g., vegan, gluten-free)
2. Nutritional Guidance: Providing nutritional information for selected meals (calories)
3. Recipe Retrieval: Filter recipes by meal type (breakfast, lunch, dinner) and cuisine.
4. Interactive Q&A: Answer user questions about nutrition and healthy eating in real time.
5. Cooking Instructions:Offer step-by-step cooking instructions for selected recipes.
